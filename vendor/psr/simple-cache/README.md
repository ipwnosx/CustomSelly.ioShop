PHP FIG Simple Cache PSR
========================

This repository holds all interfaces related to PSR-16.

Note that this is not a cache implementation of its own. It is merely an interface that describes a cache implementation. See [the specification](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-16-simple-cache.md) for more details.

You can find implementations of the specification by looking for packages providing the [psr/simple-cache-implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/simple-cache-implementation) virtual package.
